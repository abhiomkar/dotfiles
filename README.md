# dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

## install

    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhiomkar/dotfiles/master/install | sh

## what's inside

Holman's dotfile folder structure, Oh My ZSH, Homebrew, Steve Losh's vim config.

## thanks

I forked [holman](http://github.com/holman)' dotfile and made many changes 
to use oh-my-zsh and added Steve Losh's vim config.
